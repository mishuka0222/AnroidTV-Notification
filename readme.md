# PiPup

PiPup is an application that allows displaying user-defined custom notifications on Android TV.

The most common use-case for this application is for sending notifications, from a home-automation solution, to your Android TV.

Some example scenarios:

- Show a snapshot of your camera on your TV (eg on a motion trigger)
- Display a notification with the video of your camera when someone is at your door
- Send a notification when your dryer/washingmachine is ready
- Anything else you might find useful

Note:

On Android TV (8.0+), when sideloading, you will need to set the permission for SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW manually (using adb) as there is no interface on Android TV to do this.

To give the application the required permission to draw overlays you will need to run:
```
adb shell appops set nl.rogro82.pipup SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW allow
```
